### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  I pay close attention to the methods used, and whether they are redundant or not.
  In many cases it is easy to repeat yourself, and I find myself having the same urge.
  Good code is an iterative effort and should be approached as such.
- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?
  Containers could help us bin these tests in various ways, as well as help us keep
  each test relative to its respective attribute. This way, we could run more specific
  tests for each parameter.
